# git cheat sheet

A simple A3 format git cheat sheet.

This is actually the condensed notes I took as studied (and still currently studying) the excellent [progit2 book](https://github.com/progit/progit2).

## Contributing

The diagram is currently edited with the online app [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/). I have tried to export a version of the diagram as SVG in order to avoid using Lucidchart and have a local version of the sources, but proceeding so removes the ability for text fields to be edited.

If you want to contribute, either report an issue in this repository or do your modifications directly using that [LucidChart link](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/8f75e73b-2951-4ce8-9696-25244c192f98) and I will commit the changes manually to this repository.
